## Issues

- When trying to translate multiple pages, the plugin doesn't work and doesn't show any error
- **index.html** is correctly translated into the different languages listed in **./translator/langs/<LANG>.json** when selecting it
- Even after separating the different translators into two separated files, it doesn't work at all
- I also tried using the same file to avoid code duplication, it still doesn't work

> *I tried averything but it still doesn't work, if you have any solutions please contact me here: [My Discord](https://TheNolle.com/Discord)*
