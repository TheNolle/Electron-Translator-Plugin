## Infos

- You can't use a **&lt;tag&gt;** or **&lt;translate&gt;** to use the plugin inside another **&lt;tag&gt;** or **&lt;translate&gt;**
- Works for multiple pages, just need to import the plugin in every pages you want it to work in.
- Never forget to add a way for the users to change the language as I did with my popup!
- You can change the **CSS** the way you want, it won't affect the plugin!
